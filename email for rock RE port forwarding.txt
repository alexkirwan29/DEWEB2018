Rocki can you please do the following to the server for website creation:

 I would like to host a XAMPP (Web) Server so we can develop the site locally before publishing.
 For this I need some ports forwarded so I can work on it when I am at your place or at home.
 For XAMPP can i please have the following ports forwarded:

	*Apache - Port 150
	*FTP - Port 151
	*MySQL - Port 152

 I would also like to have SSH access to ~/xampp. For this i will need port 153.

 Also, I need any firewall that may stop incomming and outgoing traffic stopped for said ports (150-153)

 Also, I assume that the server has a static IP address.

Thanks,

Alex
